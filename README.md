    git clone https://github.com/nicknochnack/StableDiffusionApp
   ```

2. Install required python libraries

3. Grab your Hugging Face API token from [Here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) and paste that token in `authtoken.py`
   
4. And run the `updatedapp.py` with Visual studio code or any other IDE. Else just run in terminal
